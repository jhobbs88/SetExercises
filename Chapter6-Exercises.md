You can commit and push as many changes to your solutions as you wish; only those pushed before the chapter deadlines will be marked for the Set Exercises Assessment.

## Bonus Assessment Exercise

### Interactive HTML, CSS and Javascript resources application.

Create an interactive HTML, CSS and Javascript learning resources application which can act as a digital resource for a user to refer back to when learning web development. The application will display information about a particular web development concept, an example code snippet and then a button to run example code (which displays the result - think of Codepen). The user should be able to add, delete and modify items, and the application should be creatively styled making use of custom fonts (copyright free) and a custom colour palette. Your application must include:

* 10 HTML code items already entered.
* 10 CSS code items already entered.
* 10 Javascript code items already entered.
* An attractive, multi-column UI which features a header, navigation, body and footer.
* Full code commenting throughout.
* Clean and professional creative styling.
* The ability to enable "Dark Mode" (changes the application's theme to dark backgrounds and lighter text).
* Your application does not need to store information between loads (no database etc. required).
